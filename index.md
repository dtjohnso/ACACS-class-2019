>  "I have loved you," says the LORD. But you say, "How have you loved us?" "Is not Esau Jacob's brother?" declares the LORD. "Yet I have loved Jacob but Esau I have hated. I have laid waste his hill country and left his heritage to jackals of the desert." (<span>Mal. 1:2--3</span> ESV)

>  As it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated." (<span>Rom. 9:13</span> ESV)

## 1. Context of Romans 9:13

* Broader context of Romans (see outline from Moo[^moo])

**Romans 9:13 in flow of argument**

* Genre and structure
	- Seifrid sees Romans 9 as diatribe encapsulated by lament:
		> Paul’s opening lament provides the conceptual framework for the entire discourse, including the closing hymn of praise, which, according to the pattern of the psalms of lament, reaffirms the hope of the promises, contrary to all outward appearances (e.g., Pss. 10; 13; 22; 60; 102). The first section of Paul’s discourse (9:1–29) here is oriented around lament, which appears at the opening and closing (9:1–5, 27–29). Paul’s intervening instruction, which takes the form of diatribe, is essential to that lament, which otherwise would degenerate into unbelieving despair or a simplistic blaming of Israel.[^seifrid]
	- This sounds attractive, but seems forced. 
		- There are few structural indications of an inclusio. Romans 9:27--29 fits more closely with Rom. 9:24--26.
		- The supposed laments lack a direct appeal to God, and are not in the form of a prayer. Indeed, the text seems to be addressed directly to Paul's audience along the lines of diatribe.
	- As diatribe, 9:1--5 introduces the problem, verses 6--13 introduce a principle that helps to address the problem, and verses 14--23 respond to a logical objection introduced by that principle.^[moo]
	- Romans 9:13 supports the principle articulated in 9:6, 8.

## 2. Context of Malachi 1:2--3

### Introduction

* Malachi was highly regarded by early Christians and Jews for its conclusive message. Tertullian saw it as the link between Judaism and Christianity, while ancient Jews called it "the seal of the Prophets" and "the last among them."[^verhoef]
* Consists of messages delivered by a postexilic Palestinian prophet, though some question as to the exact identity of the author of the text. No reason to believe the original speaker was not named Malachi, though someone else may have written down his oracles.[^stuart]
* Structure: "Malachi is comprised of a superscription and six prophetic disputation speeches, the last of which may also contain a summary challenge related to the message of the book as a whole." (Stuart^[stuart])

## 4. Textual factors

In the Greek, there are a few significant textual factors, none of which affect interpretation. 

Paul's quotation varies the word order slightly from the text passed down to us by the Septuagint of Malachi:

	Rom. 9:13  καθὼς γέγραπται·     τὸν Ἰακὼβ ἠγάπησα, τὸν δὲ Ἠσαῦ ἐμίσησα. 
	Mal. 1:2-3                  καὶ ἠγάπησα τὸν Ιακωβ  τὸν δὲ Ησαυ ἐμίσησα

<!-- ^BGT^ **Mal. 1:2-3** -->
   <!--2a ἠγάπησα ὑμᾶς λέγει κύριος καὶ εἴπατε ἐν τίνι ἠγάπησας ἡμᾶς οὐκ ἀδελφὸς ἦν Ησαυ τοῦ Ιακωβ λέγει κύριος  -->
<!-- 3b καὶ ἔταξα τὰ ὅρια αὐτοῦ εἰς ἀφανισμὸν καὶ τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ εἰς δόματα ἐρήμου  -->

The Greek text from the Septuagint faithfully renders the underlying Hebrew, which reads as follows:

![]({{"/img-heb-Mal1.2-3.png" | relative_url}})

Perhaps some distinction could be made based on verb aspect between the Qal waw-consecutive imperfect *wa'ohav* (*yictol* form) referring to Jacob and the Qal perfect *sanethi* (*qatalti* form) referring to Esau. Yet none of the English translations do so.

The Greek text of Romans 9:13 includes two minor variants that are worth mentioning and two that are not worth mentioning:

1. **καθως** "just as": 
	All texts read καθως, except for Westcott-Hort and Vaticanus who read the synonym καθαπερ. This term occurs in Paul's introductory formula, not the quotation.
2. **εμισησα** "hated":
	Alexandrinus, Vaticanus, and Boernerianus read εμεισησα. The most significant witness to the reading with epsilon-iota dipthong is P46. This apparent misspelling is otherwise rare, and so only the Tyndale House GNT preserves this reading in its primary text. NA28, UBS, and SBLGNT do not mention the variant in their apparatuses. Whichever spelling is accepted, the form remains aorist active first person singular from μισέω "hate."
3. According to the CNTTS apparatus, several spellings of the proper nouns for Jacob and Esau occur.
